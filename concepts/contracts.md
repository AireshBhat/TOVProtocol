# Contracts built on top of the universal dividend

Contracts are mutual agreements between individuals or parties made for various reasons, mostly for the benefit of both the parties. Contracts that incorporate Universal Dividend as a measure of "value" can be used to build products such as mutual credit systems, commercial barter exchanges, mutual factoring. These are tools called as "Credit Commons". "Credit Commons" are a community's general judgement of the creditworthiness of each of its members[1](http://sacred-economics.com/sacred-economics-chapter-15-local-and-complementary-currency/). This now is a tool that provides fair measurement of an individuals impact in a society/community.

These contracts will use the "Web Of Trust" built by its citizens as a source of information.
