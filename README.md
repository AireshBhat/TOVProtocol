## <span id="introduction">Introduction</span>
The Transfer Of Value(TOV) Protocol aims to be a protocol standard for blockchains to interop with each others economic goods/services.

Here is a short clip of a longer video by Andreas on "what is money"

[![Money is the killer app](https://github.com/AireshBhat/TOVProtocol/assets/23222537/96727c33-28b8-48cb-93ec-27a221d0972b)](https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxIrc1rxhyI?si=nMVEtFct5IjMbUva&amp;clip=Ugkxpo3Qw-kWtUMIJoW7v2K51I3AA9iKGgKi&amp;clipt=ELDqARjwpQM)


Understanding money and its psychological effects it has on us is something that hasn't been touched upon as an educational topic. We aren't taught what money is? why is money created? how is it created? The answers to all these questions define how society is built around us. Money functions as the oil that runs the economy. How money functions also define how we create relationships between individuals we deal with.

## <span id="theory">Theory<span>

The basic idea here is to formalise a metric to measure the "value" of a service/good. This allows us to compare the same good across "economics zones", easing exchange of materials between individuals who use different currencies.

### <span id="the-relative-theory-of-money">[The Relative Theory of Money](https://trm.creationmonetaire.info/index.html)<span>
The Relative Theory of money suggests that money be created in the form of a universal dividend, the value which is a percentage of money supply, that itself has a lifetime that of which is similar to the participants taking part in the community.

We are introduced here to a currency whose value decays as time progresses. However, this is very similar to the currencies of the real worlds today which undergo inflation. Money is created by centralised entities in the forms of loans, thus increasing the money supply. Relative Theory of money suggests a new way to create this "free currency" that imbibes properties beneficial to the sustainance of an economy rather than debt, the property currency imbibes today. What "properties" are this?

The currency of a "free economy/currency" must allow a user to:
* Use resources
* Create and assign value
* Chose any monetary system of their liking
* And trade with its currency

What is a "free currency"?
A free currency is one that possesses the attributes of freedom of an individual. Here freedom, according to the RTM book, talks about "non nuisance" to oneself and others. This means that the percentage of a resource I'm consuming shouldn't block others who are in need of the same free resource.

**Ownership**

A free currency is one that is created "freely" by all the members of that community. The currency created is written in code and follows an algorithm for equal distribution amongst its members. 

A debt currency is one that is created by an entity with the expectation that it be returned, **even more** than was lent. This ties the individual to the issuer of the loan. More has been explained here as "[enslavement by the missing interest"](https://trm.creationmonetaire.info/probleme-de-la-monnaie-dette.html)

#### <span id="ud-as-a-universal-measurement-of-value">UD as a universal measurement of value</span>
In the RTM it states that, when economic goods/services are measured in terms of Universal Dividend, the rise and fall of the price accordingly denotes the rise and fall of the good/service. For eg. let's assume the US dollar was a free currency and 1 UD<sub>\$</sub> is worth 470\$. If a car priced at 100 UD<sub>\$</sub> after one year started selling at 120 UD<sub>\$</sub>, one can safely assume that the value of the car has increased. Normally, we tend to think the opposite, that the value of dollar has decreased, hence the increase in the price of the goods. 

Measuring in UD allows us to compare goods across economic zones, i.e. economies that deal with different currencies. The value an artist provides measured in UD<sub>`MUSIC`</sub> can be compared to the value a software developer provides in UD<sub>`GITHUB`</sub>

The number of UDs flowing through an identity/entity can now be a fair measure of the value that identity is contributing to the economy.
