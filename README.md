## Introduction
The Transfer Of Value(TOV) Protocol aims to be a protocol standard for blockchains to interop with each others economics goods.
* The blockchain must must measure the value of their goods and services in terms of a Universal Dividend.
* If the blockchain impelements a token, the distribution of token must follow "spatial" and "temporal" symmetries in order to ensure equal distribution of "new currency" to all participants. Following this symmetry allows us to calculate the share of new currency each individual in the community can earn, mirroring the functions of a Universal Dividend. 
* Measuring goods in terms of Universal Dividend allows us to compare the value of a good/service an "identity" Ia who is part of "community" Ca created with another good created by "identity" Ib who is part of "community" Cb.
* A Web Of Trust is built by the community. A Web of Trust is the digital equivalent of a group of individuals who trust each other. This web is built upon collecting certificates of individuals verifying others to create a graph of identities as nodes and edges are certificates pointing who is verifying whom.

## Theory

### [The Relative Theory of Money](https://trm.creationmonetaire.info/index.html)
The Relative Theory of money suggests that money be created in the form of a universal dividend, the value which is a percentage of money supply, that itself has a lifetime that of which is similar to the participants taking part in the community.

We are introduced here to a currency whose value decays as time progresses. However, this is very similar to the currencies of the real worlds today which undergo inflation. Money is created by centralised entities in the forms of loans, thus increasing the money supply. Relative Theory of money suggests a new way to create this "free currency" that imbibes properties beneficial to the sustainance of an economy rather than debt, the property currency imbibes today. What "properties" are this?

The currency of a "free economy/currency" must allow a user to:
* Use resources
* Create and assign value
* Chose any monetary system of their liking
* And trade with its currency

What is a "free currency"?
A free currency is one that possesses the attributes of freedom. This might be hard to visualise hence lets look at it in the form of a comparison.

**Ownership**
A free currency is one that is created "freely" by all the members of that community. The currency created is written in code and follows an algorithm for equal distribution amongst its members.

A debt currency is one that is created by an entity with the expectation that it be returned, even more than was lent. This ties the individual to the issuer of the loan.
